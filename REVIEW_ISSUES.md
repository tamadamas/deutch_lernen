## German Teacher Review

## The Core Problem

You jumped from A1 to B1+ content (past tense narrative). That's like trying to read Elixir metaprogramming documentation when you just learned `def` and `end`. The cognitive load is crushing your motivation.

## What Actually Works (Evidence-Based)

### 1. **Comprehensible Input (i+1 Principle)**
You need content that's *slightly* above your level - maybe 80-90% comprehensible, not 10%.

**Right now, do this:**
- **Keep your Wednesday book** for *passive exposure only* - listen while commuting, cooking, whatever. Don't stress about understanding.
- **Get graded readers** at A1-A2 level (André Klein's "Café in Berlin" series, Olly Richards' short stories). These use past tense but with A2 vocabulary.

### 2. **Your Word-by-Word Strategy is Inefficient**

I know it *feels* productive, but research shows:
- **Lookup every word** → you forget context, exhaust yourself
- **Better approach**: Lookup only words that appear 3+ times or block comprehension

**For your writing app** (ich liebe die Idee übrigens):
```
Instead of: Word → Dictionary → Write
Do: Sentence mining → Spaced repetition → Active recall
```

Build something like:
- **SRS flashcards** with sentences from YOUR reading
- **Cloze deletions** (fill-in-the-blank from context)
- **Audio snippets** attached to each card

### 3. **Parallel Processing Strategy**

Since you're in an A1 course with 6 months to B1:

**Daily routine (2 hours total):**

| Time | Activity | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 30 min | **A1 course homework** | Foundation grammar |
| 30 min | **Graded reader A2** with audio | Comprehensible input + pronunciation |
| 15 min | **Wednesday audiobook** at 0.9x | Passive ear training (don't analyze!) |
| 30 min | **Anki/your app** | Active recall of sentences you mined |
| 15 min | **Write 3 sentences** about your day | Active production |

### 4. **Past Tense Specifically**

German past tense is tricky (Perfekt vs. Präteritum). Your A1 course will cover this systematically. **Don't jump ahead** - you'll internalize wrong patterns.

**When you encounter past in Wednesday:**
- Just notice the pattern: `hat gemacht`, `ist gegangen`
- Don't analyze yet - let your brain collect data
- Your course will explain the rules at the right time

## Your Writing Application - Feature Priority

Als Architekt, hier meine Empfehlung:

**MVP (Month 1-2):**
1. Import sentences from books (OCR or manual)
2. Audio playback (TTS or real audio)
3. Basic SRS algorithm (SM-2)
4. Cloze deletion generator

**Phase 2:**
5. Grammar pattern recognition (tag sentences by tense/case)
6. Personal vocabulary frequency tracker
7. Conjugation practice generator

**Phase 3:**
8. Integration with your course materials
9. Speaking practice with STT feedback
10. Progress visualization toward B1

**Tech stack idea:**
```elixir
# Phoenix LiveView für reactive UI
# Ecto für persistence
# Nx für NLP pattern matching
# Membrane für audio processing
```

## Brutal Honesty

Your current Wednesday approach is **not learning** - it's cognitive overload masquerading as progress. You're training frustration tolerance, not German comprehension.

**The uncomfortable truth:** You need to read "easier" content first. Yes, it feels childish. Yes, you want to read "real" books. But A2 graded readers will get you to Wednesday *faster* than struggling with Wednesday now.

## 6-Month Roadmap to B1

**Month 1-2:** A1 course + A2 graded readers (5-6 books)
**Month 3-4:** A2 course content + Easy A2-B1 novels
**Month 5:** B1 materials + Your Wednesday book (you'll actually understand it!)
**Month 6:** Exam prep + consolidation

**Meine Empfehlung:** Trust the process. Your systematische approach is gut, but you need to calibrate the difficulty level.
